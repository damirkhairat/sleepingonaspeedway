        long_description: '<b>i. Project context</b><br/><p>Situated in the expansive deserts of Southwestern Arizona, the US Army Yuma Proving Ground (YPG) is one of the largest military test sites in the world. The selection of this location is the result of extensive studies to find terrains that are analogous to Middle Eastern deserts, where the US has been active militarily for thirty years. Here, a despotic system of production creates weapons that master and make use of desert climates.</p><p>Despite US soil being used to simulate <i>future conflict</i>, the analogous climate and in turn, analogous climate change-related hostilities in the American Southwest and Middle East produce a <i>shared precarity</i> for bodies on opposing ends of these simulations. <i>Gulf War Illness</i> is a body of research comprising case studies which explore and articulate a set of chronic conditions being experienced globally by respiratory systems in similar harsh desert climates. Largely, these studies are situated in two cities––Yuma, home to YPG, and Baghdad––where these shared conditions are exacerbated by US military activity and training.</p><br/><b>ii. Installation</b><br/><p>The research of <i>Gulf War Illness</i> manifests through an installation in which a film narrating these case-studies is screened within a loosely-reproduced YPG facility. This mock-facility features a <i>dust aggravation chamber</i>, a system commonly used at YPG to ensure weapon durability by exposing them to simulations of dust storms. This chamber provides a three-dimensional layer to the film, presenting the climate-conditions it narrates in real-time.</p><p>In contrast to the weapons tested at YPG, the device tested in <i>this</i> dust aggravation chamber is a low-cost medical ventilator. Such medical devices are used to treat extreme respiratory issues, ailments which will certainly increase in prevalence as climate conditions in Yuma and Baghdad deteriorate. Similarly synchronized with the film, this ventilator is an artificial stand-in for the respiratory systems of individuals featured in the case studies––imitating how one under these conditions would breathe and at times, struggle and fail to.</p><p>The ventilator used in this project has an unconventional build, using a combination of open-source assets and declassified YPG weapon design documents relating to dust. Thus, while this device is representative of the respiratory systems in these climates, it underscores the stark discrepancy between the machines optimized for these environments and the bodies that are forced to endure them. Yet, in leveraging weapon design documents to build a medical device, the aim of <i>Gulf War Illness</i> is to speculate how YPG assets could be reappropriated––producing an alternative conclusion to that of YPG’s original architects.</p><p>Considering, could such assets be leveraged to produce mutualistic computation where the vulnerable in <i>many regions</i> become tightly networked beneficiaries, rather than in favor of a single despot? Thinking more broadly, analogous conditions exist in many contexts globally and thus, could such a model be reproducible and multiplicious?</p>',

        long_description: "<p>Father Stephen Lesniewski is a Chicago-based priest and ardent abortion access opponent who has been active since the early 1990s. Though relatively unknown, Lesniewski’s name appears alongside the earliest mentions online of the “Letter from an Unborn Child”––a viral form of anti-abortion content which is frequently shared amongst right-wing circles. The “letter” is written from the perspective of an aborted child speaking to its mother.</p><p><a href=\"https://wng.org/articles/letter-from-an-aborted-child-1617287857\" target=\"_blank\">According to a number of evangelical journals,</a> this letter was written by the priest or a member of his parish in the early 2000s. Shortly thereafter, Lesniewski recorded an eight year old child reading the letter and began distributing CD copies of this audio outside of abortion clinics. The audio is disturbing, creating a character that, at its core, effectively masks its middle-aged author. </p><p>In the decades since, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@fatherstephen6925/videos\" target=\"_blank\">Lesniewski has also recorded and uploaded dozens of digital sermons to his YouTube channel.</a> Each video, running nearly half an hour, is full of gaffes, non sequiturs, unintelligible comments and factual errors. They are unlike the audio recording of the “Letter from the Unborn Child,” which is to say they don’t conceal Lesniewski’s voice behind a character, instead presenting the priest and his ideologies bare.</p><p>This installation is an explicit representation of how Lesniewski projected his incoherent oration onto an illusory character––one which he depended on for emotional appeal. Here, a hyper-realistic  baby/doll––representing the fictional character Stephen Lesniewski created––watches Lesniewski’s sermons on a television and translates them into similar phrases from the “Letter from an Unborn Child.” This works through a call and response system, where the baby actively listens for phrases and responds using Natural Language Processing semantic matching techniques.</p><p>The letter and the priest's manipulation of it signifies a rudimentary prelude to the current landscape of methods used by political operatives. Namely, in which content production and technology are used beyond misinformation, but to achieve emotional appeal by distorting the very nature of reality––creating an <i>imaginary</i> under which their arguments are more tenable. With the recording of a child, the imaginary that Lesniewski created was the existence of “Unborn Child” itself, which having never been born, could only ever have <i>truly lived</i> in his dreams. Today, this kind of reality-production has exponentiated, occurring at the high octane churn of content production––where audiences are immersed in imaginaries which have only grown in sophistication since Lesniewski.</p>",
